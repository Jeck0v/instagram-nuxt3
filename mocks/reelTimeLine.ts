        ‚úèÔ∏è Lyrics
        I'm so lucky lucky
        I'm so lucky lucky
        I'm so lovely lovely
        I'm so lovely lovely
        
        You can fool yourself
        I promise it will help
        Now every single day
        I just wanna hear you saying
        
        I'm so lucky lucky
        I'm so lucky lucky
        I'm so lovely lovely
        I'm so lovely lovely
        
        You can fool yourself
        I promise it will help
        Now every single day
        I just wanna hear you saying
        
        I'm so lucky lucky
        I'm so lovely lovely
        
        You can fool yourself
        I promise it will help
        Now every single day
        I just wanna hear you saying
        
        Even though you said
        It would never end it's over
        You were smiling on my arm
        Now you're crying on my shoulder
        
        There's nothing you can do
        To keep it out
        There's nothing you can do
        Just scream and shout, saying:
        
        I'm so lucky lucky
        I'm so lucky lucky
        I'm so lovely lovely
        I'm so lovely lovely
        
        You can fool yourself
        I promise it will help
        Now every single day
        I just wanna hear you saying
        
        I'm so lucky lucky
        I'm so lucky lucky
        I'm so lovely lovely
        I'm so lovely lovely
        
        You can fool yourself
        I promise it will help
        Now every single day
        I just wanna hear you saying
        
        I'm so lucky lucky
        I'm so lovely lovely
        
        You can fool yourself
        I promise it will help
        Now every single day
        I just wanna hear you saying
        
        I'm so lucky lucky
        I'm so lucky lucky
        I'm so lovely lovely
        I'm so lovely lovely
        
        You can fool yourself
        I promise it will help
        Now every single day
        I just wanna hear you saying
