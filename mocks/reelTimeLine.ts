        ✏️ Lyrics
        Let's make this fleeting moment last forever
        So tell me, what you waitin' for?
        I'm gonna keep it frozen here forever
        There's no regretting anymore
        It's worth to wait, even so far away
        I'm making the night mine until the day I die
        No light to break when you're hangin' by fate
        You know what it feels like when you're dancing blind
        All alone just the beat inside my soul
        Take me home where my dreams are made of gold
        In the zone where the beat is uncontrolled
        I know what it feels like
        Come on, make me feel alive!
        
        Meet me under shining lights
        I've been waiting right here all my life
        Feelings you can't deny that you're living
        Open up your eyes
        And I just wanna sink into your crazy laughter
        Come on make me feel until the pain don't matter
        Every second here makes my heart beat faster
        Finally think I found what I'm chasing after
        All alone just the beat inside my soul
        Take me home where my dreams are made of gold
        In the zone where the beat is uncontrolled
        I know what it feels like
        Come on, make me feel alive!
        
        All alone just the beat inside my soul
        Take me home where my dreams are made of gold
        In the zone where the beat is uncontrolled
        I know what it feels like
        Come on, make me feel alive!
